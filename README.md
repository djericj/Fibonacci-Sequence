# Fibonacci-Sequence

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

{\displaystyle F_{0}=0,\quad F_{1}=1,}{\displaystyle F_{0}=0,\quad F_{1}=1,}
and

{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2},}{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2},}
for n > 1.

One has F2 = 1. In some books, and particularly in old ones, F0, the "0" is omitted, and the Fibonacci sequence starts with F1 = F2 = 1.[2][3] The beginning of the sequence is thus:

{\displaystyle (0,)\;1,\;1,\;2,\;3,\;5,\;8,\;13,\;21,\;34,\;55,\;89,\;144,\;\ldots }{\displaystyle (0,)\;1,\;1,\;2,\;3,\;5,\;8,\;13,\;21,\;34,\;55,\;89,\;144,\;\ldots }[4]

The Fibonacci spiral: an approximation of the golden spiral created by drawing circular arcs connecting the opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling;[5] (see preceding image)
Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet's formula expresses the nth Fibonacci number in terms of n and the golden ratio, and implies that the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio as n increases.
