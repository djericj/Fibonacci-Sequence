# Fibonacci-Sequence

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

>F0 = 0, F1 = 1

and

>Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
for *n* > 1.

One has *F2 = 1*. In some books, and particularly in old ones, *F0*, the "0" is omitted, and the Fibonacci sequence starts with F1 = F2 = 1.[2][3] The beginning of the sequence is thus:

> (0,) 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
